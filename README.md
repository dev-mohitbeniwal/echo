# Echo - Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) System

Echo is a robust, scalable Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) system designed to provide fine-grained access control for modern applications. It offers a flexible policy management system, high-performance policy evaluation, and comprehensive auditing capabilities.

## Features

- **Fine-grained Access Control**: Implement complex access control policies based on user attributes, resource attributes, and environmental conditions.
- **High-Performance Policy Evaluation**: Utilizes Neo4j for efficient policy storage and evaluation.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with Go and designed to handle high loads.
- **Real-time Policy Updates**: Policies can be updated in real-time without system downtime.
- **Comprehensive Auditing**: All access decisions are logged and can be analyzed for security and compliance purposes.
- **Caching**: Redis-based caching for improved performance.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Utilizes an event bus for asynchronous processing of policy changes and notifications.
- **RESTful API**: Easy integration with existing systems through a well-defined API.
- **Containerized Deployment**: Docker and Docker Compose support for easy deployment and scaling.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Go (Gin web framework)
- **Database**: Neo4j (for policy storage and evaluation)
- **Cache**: Redis
- **Search and Audit Log**: Elasticsearch
- **Frontend**: React with Next.js (work in progress)
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Go 1.16 or later (for local development)
- Node.js and npm (for frontend development)

### Running the Application

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/echo.git
   cd echo
   ```

2. Start the application using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   cd deploy
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

### Development Setup

1. Set up the Go environment:

   ```bash
   cd api
   go mod download
   ```

2. Set up the frontend environment (when ready):

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the backend locally:

   ```bash
   cd api
   go run main.go
   ```

4. Run the frontend locally (when ready):

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```

## API Documentation

[API documentation will be provided here, possibly using Swagger]

## Configuration

Configuration is managed through environment variables and the `config.yaml` file. Key configuration options include:

- `NEO4J_URI`: URI for the Neo4j database
- `REDIS_ADDR`: Address of the Redis server
- `ELASTICSEARCH_URL`: URL of the Elasticsearch instance
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level (e.g., debug, info, warn, error)

For a complete list of configuration options, see `api/config/config.yaml`.
